Hi there, I'm Ry. I used to program in Lua via Roblox but I sort of took a break and I forgot almost everything related to scripting lmao, so now I just make Discord themes for fun since that's I like doing. Most of my themes are privated/discontinued since I work on **ALOT** of themes (and I never finish them). My main focus rn is Synthcord Frame which is a translucent [Discord](https://discord.com) theme that replaces their ugly colors with a neon background to accurately emulate a Synthwave experience.
